Created a Coding Quiz Challeneg which is based on time 

Once you START the quiz , you will be given 100 seconds to complete the whole quiz. 
If any answer selected is wrong , you will get a message displaying the correct answer and 10 seconds will be deducted from your time left . 

If you run out of time , quiz ends . 

You would need to enter your initials to gauage your progress compared to others. 

Highscores will be stored in local storage and can be cleared by clicking the clear button.
